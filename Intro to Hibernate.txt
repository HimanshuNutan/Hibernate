
HIBERNATE

- Open source java persistence framework
- Object Relational Mapping tool(ORM) for java
- we can map java classes to database tables and map java datatypes to SQL data types
- we can perform CRUD operations and much more without writing any SQL statements


----HIBERNATE QUERY Language allows you to write object oriented queries for advanced options.
----Implementation of Java Persistence API(JPA) so our code has hight interoperability with other Java EE applications.

Features
---Object relational mapping
---Jpa provider - set of specifications for accessing, persisting and managing data
---Idiomatic Persistence - any class that allow OO principles such as inheritance,
         polymorphism can be used a persistent class
--- High performance and scalability - coz provides cache mechanism(2 levels of caching - first level and second
level caching), lazy initialization, optimistic locking(versioning)
