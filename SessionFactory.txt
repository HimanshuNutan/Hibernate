->Session factory uses configuration information to instantiate session object appropriately.
->A thread safe and immutable representation of the mapping of the application domain model to a database
->Acts as a factory for org.hibernate.Session instances.
->Session Factory is very expensive to create so for any database, the application should have only one associated 
Session Factory
->EntityManager Factory is the JPA equivalent of SessionFactory.


-------------Session----------
represents interaction between application and database at an point of time
session is short lived object, single threaded
in JPA session is represented by EntityManager
Behind the scenes the Hibernate session wraps a JDBC java.sql.Connection and acts as a factory for 
org.hibernate.Transaction instances.


-------------Query-------------
allows application to query the database for one or more stored objects.
Hibernate provides different techniques to query database including NamedQuery and Criteria API.


------------First Level Cache--------------------

represents the default cache used by Hibernate Session

------------Transaction----------------------
helps in achieving data consistency

------------Persistent Objects-------------------
POJO's which get persisted as one of the rows in related table in database 

-----------Second level cache-----
cache for sessionfactory, used to store objects across sessions
EhCache - common second level cache providers
